<DOC><![CDATA[The database runbook functions allow you to cover basic deployment scenarios specific for MSSQL databases. 

You can for example create new databases, backups etc. You can also execute arbitrary SQL-queries or -scripts (e.g. your deployment migration scripts).

=Supported Databases= 

The runbook functions use standard SQL queries executed over a JDBC connection to the database. The following system was tested:

* MSSQL on Windows Server 2008 R2

=Setup=

* the JDBC driver jar files are not shipped with the Actions library. Download the appropriate JDBC driver (my-JDBC-driver.jar) matching to your database and put it on the executing agent host.

* define the path to your JDBC driver jar file in the variable 'JDBC Driver JAR URI' (e.g. sqljdbc4.jar for MSSQL)

* define the main driver class of your jar file. See your JDBC vendor's documentation for more details. (E.g. com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver for the sqljdbc4.jar for the MSSQL JDBC driver)

* define the connection string in the property 'JDBC Connection String'. See your JDBC vendor's documentation for more details.


=Rollback=

The MSSQL Database actions do not have rollbacks defined yet.
